My Solutions to the reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer challenges

The following description of the site was taken on the 11th April 2014:

*Welcome to r/DailyProgrammer! The focus of this subreddit is to provide programming challenges. Challenges are user-submitted and solutions are peer-reviewed.*
- *We post every Monday (Easy), Wednesday (Intermediate), and Fridays (Hard). All challenges are user-submitted and reviewed by moderators, and solutions may be written in any programming language.*
- *Solutions are verified by the community, so your approach will be test more than actual code, though ask explicitly for code-review if that's what you're looking for. Note that the most recent challenges will be more actively discussed.*
- *Post your code in the thread's comments (any code prefaced by four spaces will be automatically hidden, much like a spoiler), or use a third-party service like Github:Gist. Posting code as a comment will get you much more views.*
- *Try challenging yourself with creative solutions or use new language; easy challenges are meant to encourage experimentation, while harder challenges encourage problem-solving.*
